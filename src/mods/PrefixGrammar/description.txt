Changes how prefixes are rendered in item names to be more grammatical.

Prefixes will be inserted after articles (e.g. Unreal The Undertaker -> The Unreal Undertaker).

Additionally, you can also optionally choose to change how item names that start with a prefix name are handled (such as the Lucky Horseshoe):
- default (Arcane Lucky Horseshoe)
- replace (Arcane Horseshoe)
- after (Lucky Arcane Horseshoe).

For the rare cases where an item name begins with the same name as a prefix, additional options are provided for their handling:
- default (Lucky Lucky Horseshoe),
- doubly (Doubly-Lucky Horseshoe).

In either case (aside from replace and doubly), there is also a case to insert a comma between the two prefixes.

Currently, only support for English is featured. Get in contact with me through the homepage if you'd like support for other languages.
Some other languages are pretty straightforward, but I don't know the rules of others (so I'd rather native speakers help directly).
